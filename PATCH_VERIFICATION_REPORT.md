**Status:** ✅ All fixes verified and applied

---

## Executive Summary

The user provided a unified diff patch addressing 3 issues discovered during engine integration:

1. **Yuanjin function ordering error** - ✅ Already fixed
2. **Combination element test expectation error** - ✅ Already fixed
3. **Void validation enhancement** - ✅ Now applied

**Result:** All patches successfully verified. One additional test added.

---

## Patch Details

### 1. Yuanjin Function Ordering Fix

**Issue:** `_sort_pair()` was called before being defined, causing `NameError`

**Patch location:** `core/policy_engines/yuanjin.py`

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY FIXED in commit `049aa83`

**Verification:**
```python
# Current implementation (line 52):
# --- 내부 유틸 (정책 로드 전에 필요) ------------------------------------------
def _sort_pair(a: str, b: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """쌍 내부를 BRANCHES 인덱스 기준으로 정렬."""
    return (a, b) if _BR_INDEX[a] <= _BR_INDEX[b] else (b, a)
```

**Action taken:** Function moved from line 116 to line 52 during initial integration

**File:** `services/analysis-service/app/core/yuanjin.py:52`

---

### 2. Combination Element Test Expectation Fix

**Issue:** Test expected water to stay at 0.2, but it should decrease when metal increases

**Patch location:** `tests/engines/test_combination_element.py:test_multiple_targets_same_order_first_only()`

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY FIXED in commit `9ce4250`

**Verification:**
```python
# Current implementation (line 107):
# water는 metal 증가에 기여하므로 감소
assert dist["water"] < 0.2  # ✅ Correct expectation
```

**Original bug:**
```python
# WRONG (would have been):
assert pytest.approx(0.2, abs=1e-9) == dist["water"]  # ❌ Incorrect
```

**Explanation:** When metal gets +0.10, that amount comes proportionally from ALL other elements including water:
- Water starts at 0.2 out of 0.8 total "others"
- Water contributes: 0.10 × (0.2 / 0.8) = 0.025
- Water final: 0.2 - 0.025 = 0.175 ✓

**File:** `services/analysis-service/tests/test_combination_element.py:107`

### 3. Void Validation Enhancement (NEW)

**Issue:** Missing validation test for invalid `kong` input in `apply_void_flags()`

**Patch location:** `tests/engines/test_void_calc.py`

**Status:** ✅ NEWLY ADDED in commit `6245d78`

**Implementation:**
```python
def test_apply_void_flags_invalid_kong_raises():
    """Test that apply_void_flags raises ValueError for invalid kong input"""
    # 잘못된 kong 길이
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        vc.apply_void_flags(["子", "丑", "寅", "卯"], ["子"])
    # kong에 12지지가 아닌 값 포함
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        vc.apply_void_flags(["子", "丑", "寅", "卯"], ["子", "A"])
    # branches 길이가 4가 아니어도 에러
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        vc.apply_void_flags(["子", "丑", "寅"], ["子", "丑"])
```

**Test results:**
- Before: 14/14 tests passing
- After: **15/15 tests passing** ✅

**File:** `services/analysis-service/tests/test_void.py:89-99`

## Verification Steps Performed

1. **Read patch diff** - Analyzed all 3 proposed changes
2. **Compare against current code** - Verified 2/3 already applied
3. **Apply missing enhancement** - Added void validation test
4. **Run all tests** - Confirmed 33/33 passing
5. **Commit changes** - Documented enhancement
6. **Create this report** - For future reference

---

## Conclusion

✅ **All patch fixes verified and applied**

The patch correctly identified 3 issues:
- 2 were already fixed during initial integration (yuanjin ordering, combination test)
- 1 enhancement was missing and has now been added (void validation test)

**Current status:** All 3 engines are production-ready with comprehensive test coverage (33/33 tests passing).

**Branch:** `docs/prompts-freeze-v1`

---

## Next Steps

Per user request, engines remain standalone until all engines are ready. Future work:

1. Integrate engines into `AnalysisEngine.analyze()`
2. Update `AnalysisResponse` model with new fields
3. Create integration tests
4. Update API documentation

**No immediate action required** - all engines verified and ready for integration.
