# Example — Applying v2.1
- Day Master: 丙  | Month: 午 (庚 on month stem)
- Deukryeong: 得令 via 午(火旺). Month-stem 庚=관성(counter) → strength -10% (capped).
- Relations: only banhe present (亥+未 with 卯 season) → boost weight 0.5, no transform.
- Five-he: 甲+己 present but no 化神透干 → interpretation-only, no replacement in calc.
- Zixing: none (no dup, no seasonal gate).
- Seal validity: 印 exists but 財 충 → seal -> none.
- Luck start: (birth→next 入節 days)/3.0 = 3.42 years.
